			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<div id="accordion-div">

				<button class="accordion">Do I need tickets?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called
						"The Greatest
						Free Show on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades
						pass.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see
						question below)
						and ends on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent
						begins. It is
						also common for people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat
						Tuesday "Mardi
						Gras Day." Locals tend to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading
						up to Tuesday
						are"Mardi Gras."
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">What is Twelfth Night? </button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Twelfth Night (aka, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is January 6th and is the
						official start of
						Mardi Gras every year. While the date of Fat Tuesday changes, Twelfth Night does not.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">When was the first Mardi Gras?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They
						began the
						tradition of presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and
						their guests.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">What is the significance of the Mardi Gras colors, and where did they come
					from?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Rex, the King of Carnival, selected the Mardi Gras colors and assigned meaning to them in 1892.
						Purple stands
						for justice, green for faith, and gold for power.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Why are masks worn?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone
						else, and the elaborate masks that some wear add to the fun.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How is a king chosen?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings,
						while others invite
						a celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School of
						Design, who sponsors
						the Rex parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How long have "throws" been around?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>The tradition of float riders throwing trinkets to the crowds began in the 1870s, and continues
						today. Typical
						throws include beads, cups, doubloons and stuffed animals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How does Mardi Gras benefit the New Orleans economy?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Economic impact reports indicate that Mardi Gras generates over $1 billion in annual spending.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How is the City government involved?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>City governments are not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades. The governments issue
						parade permits, but
						that is the extent of their involvement. Krewes independently schedule and coordinate their own
						parades.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Who organizes and pays for Mardi Gras?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Mardi Gras parade krewes are private, non-profit organizations whose members get together year
						round to plan
						their parade's theme, costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club, as they are known, is
						individually funded
						by its members. They support their krewe through dues, sales of krewe-related merchandise to
						their members, and
						fundraising. Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes have corporate sponsors. <br>
						The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades; their only
						involvement is to issue
						parade permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that schedules and coordinates its own
						parade.

					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Who first broadcast Mardi Gras LIVE on the Internet?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, of course. They organized and presented the first live Mardi Gras in
						1995
						and continued
						sharing this with our visitors for several years with companies like Microsoft and REAL Media.
						The live events
						showcased on MardiGrasNewOrleans.com have been covered by the New York Times, Chicago Tribune,
						TImes PIcayune,
						Morning Advocate, San Diego Union Tribune, Texas Monthly, and the Discovery Channel among
						others.
						<br><br>
						The first year, we presented the Orpheuscapade, and soon offered live chats with celebrities,
						interviews with
						costumed revelers on the streets, and video from atop hotels in the Garden District.
