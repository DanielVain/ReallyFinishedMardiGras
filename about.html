						<h3>What is Mardi Gras?</h3>
						<p>
							the holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
							Orleans.
							Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
							before
							Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one
							major
							parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
							most
							elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week,
							many
							events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
							(some
							of them masquerade balls).

				<p>
					The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
					parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of
					Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super
					krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is
					best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
					(similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure
					Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds.
					The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw
					cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route
					each year.

				<h2>LaToya Cantrell</h2>
				<p>
					LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of
					New Orleans,
					Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold
					the post. Before
					becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012-2018.
					Cantrell was
					inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's history.
					Once in
					office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic
					plan to address
					families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
					finding
					solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the
					city for city
					use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public
					transportation,
					public parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New
					Orleans filed a
					lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.
